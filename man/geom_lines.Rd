\usage{
geom_median_lines(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  ...,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)

geom_mean_lines(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  ...,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behavior from
the default plot specification.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer (\code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}) that can be added to a plot
created with \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}}.
}
\description{
These geoms can be used to draw horizontal or vertical reference
lines in a ggplot. They use the data in the aesthetics \code{x0} and \code{y0}
to compute their \code{median} or \code{mean} and draw them as a line.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_median_lines()} and \code{geom_mean_lines()} understand the following
aesthetics (at least one of the bold aesthetics is required):
\itemize{
\item{\strong{x0}}{ - The variable for which to compute the median/mean that is drawn as vertical line.}
\item{\strong{y0}}{ - The variable for which to compute the median/mean that is drawn as horizontal line.}
\item{\code{alpha = NA}}{ - The alpha channel, i.e. transparency level, as a numerical value between 0 and 1.}
\item{\code{color = "red"}}{ - The color of the drawn lines.}
\item{\code{linetype = 2}}{ - The linetype of the drawn lines.}
\item{\code{size = 0.5}}{ - The size of the drawn lines. Deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0, use \code{linewidth} instead.}
\item{\code{linewidth = 0.5}}{ - The size of the drawn lines.}
}
}
